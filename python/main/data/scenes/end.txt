The lights go out, leaving you in the dark, warm, humid cavity of the mainframe's central nervous system.

The ship seizes. It holds its breath, the air flowing from its bronchial tubes going still. It feels like forever, but lasts but a single heartbeat.

A hum wells up from deep within the ship, resonating with the flesh. You can feel the tremors through the soles of your feet. You hold onto the terminal to keep yourself steady. It shudders and then goes silent. You hear nothing but the unnatural breathing of the ship made flesh.

<option nextScene="end_4a">...the lights come back on.</option>

The lights come back on so suddenly it blinds you.

You feel them before you see them. They climb onto you with little suckers, biting into your flesh, scurrying across your body.

<option nextScene="end_5b">Watch helplessly.</option>

You struggle and tear the tiny snail-like creatures from your skin. But there are too many of them and they overcome your efforts.

As they attach themselves to your body, each bite comes with a rush of endorphins. You suddenly feel elated and calm. The euphoria overwhelms you. You stop struggling.

The last thing you hear before you fall is the mainframe whispering, "<t>MY CHILDREN...</t>"

<option nextScene="end_6">Give in to the bliss.</option>

You lay helplessly against the computer terminal as countless snail-like creatures cover your skin.

As they attach themselves to your body, each bite comes with a rush of endorphins. You suddenly feel elated and calm. The euphoria overwhelms you. You stop struggling.

The last thing you hear before you fall is the mainframe whispering, "<t>MY CHILDREN...</t>"

You can't move anymore but you don't care. The ship moves you through it's digestive system and births you out into a small pod.

The feel of cold metal against your skin feels foreign now. You open your eyes and see the words, "ESCAPE POD - EMERGENCY ONLY" etched into the glass but you don't understand them. You just want to sleep. A red light blinks slowly, hypnotizing you.

<option nextScene="end_7">Sleep...</option>
</scene>

<scene>
<meta id="end_7" styles="style_mission" />
Rough plastic hand grip your sensitive red skin, lifting you out of your reverie.

"Where is it from?"

"Forget the name... it's that ship that went dark a few months ago."

"Well, better get this crew member to the medbay, right now. Don't look so healthy..."

They jostle you out of the escape pod. Bright lights burn through your sensitive corneas. You find comfort only in knowing that you are not alone. You can still feel them beneath your skin. The brood. They are with you still. You smile contentedly.

Sirens suddenly start. You hear an announcement over the loudspeakers. "CONTAINMENT BREACH. INFECTION DETECTED. QUARANTINE PROTOCOLS ENACTED."

<option action="restart">End it.</option>
