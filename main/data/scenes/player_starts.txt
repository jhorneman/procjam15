You wake up with a start. How long have you been asleep? What has happened?

Your training kicks in and you take stock of the situation. You're on the ship. Everything seems fine. No blinking lights. No sirens.

A message awaits you. "{^$PC_job} {$PC_last}, {$PC_first}. Please report to the computer room."

The computer room? Better go see what that is about. xx

You slowly come back to consciousness. You're lying on a cot. Why aren't you in your bed?

Why is your shirt covered in blood?

A message awaits you. "{$PC_first} {$PC_last}, please report to the computer room."

The computer room. xx

Out of a hole in the wall, a voice sings: "{^$PC_job}! Please come to the computer room!" Like a herald, inviting you to your judgment. xx
