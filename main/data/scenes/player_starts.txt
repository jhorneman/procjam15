You wake up with a start. How long have you been asleep? What has happened?

Your training kicks in and you take stock of the situation. You're lying on a cot. You're on the ship. Everything seems fine. No blinking lights. No sirens.<injectBlock tags="pc_start, flesh_act1" norepeat="1" />

A message awaits you. "{^$PC_job} {$PC_last}, {$PC_first}. Please report to the computer room."

The computer room? Better go see what that is about.

You wake up with a start. How long have you been asleep? What has happened?

Your training kicks in and you take stock of the situation. You're lying on a cot. You're on the ship. Of course you're on the ship. Why aren't any of the lights blinking?

You slowly come back to consciousness. You're lying on a cot. Why aren't you in your bed? 

Why is your shirt covered in blood?

A message awaits you. "{$PC_first} {$PC_last}, please report to the computer room."

The computer room.

<leadin>Wake up...</leadin>
How long have you been curled in this corner? What happened to your hands?

Out of a hole in the wall, a voice sings: "{^$PC_job}! Please come to the computer room!" Like a herald, inviting you to your judgment.

<leadin>Wake up...</leadin>
Adrenaline hits your bloodstream and you instantly snap awake. Filled with purpose, you tear yourself loose from the tubes, the sinews, the nourishing liquid. Your DNA sings to you, and you know where to go.
