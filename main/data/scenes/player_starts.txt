<leadin>Start the game.</leadin>
You wake up with a start. How long have you been asleep? What has happened?
<br/>
<br/>
Your training kicks in and you take stock of the situation. You're lying on a cot. You're on the ship. Everything seems fine. No blinking lights. No sirens.
<br/>
<br/>
A message awaits you.
<br/>
<br/>
"Private {PC_last}, {PC_first}. Please report to the computer room."
<br/>
<br/>
The computer room? Better go see what that is about.
