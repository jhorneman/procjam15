You wake up.

Red emergency lights give a soft warm glow to the dark sterile room. It contains a bed, a sink, and a computer terminal beside the only exit. You do not know how long you have been asleep. You do not recognize this room.

The computer terminal contains a single message. "<t>{^$PC_job} {$PC_last}, {$PC_first}. Please report to the mainframe.</t>"

You wake up.

Consciousness returns slowly. Red emergency lights give a soft warm glow to the dark sterile room. You taste something metallic. You reach your fingers to your mouth and they are coated in blood, but you do not appear to be injured.

You do not know how long you have been asleep. You do not recognize this room.

You wake up.

Consciousness returns slowly. You pick yourself up off of the hard metalic floor and lean against the wall. Your hair is matted with a sticky substance you can't identify. The taste of ammonia lingers in your mouth. 

You do not know how long you have been asleep. You do not recognize this room.

The computer terminal contains a single message. "<t>{^$PC_job} {$PC_last}, {$PC_first}. We need you in the mainframe.</t>"

You wake up.

Consciousness returns slowly. You peel yourself from within a comforting cocoon of membranes. Your hair is matted with a sticky substance you can't identify. The taste of ammonia lingers in your mouth. 

You do not know how long you have been asleep. You do not recognize this room, but it feels comforting.

You wake up.

Consciousness returns slowly. You peel yourself from within a comforting cocoon of membranes and detach tubes of sinewy flesh delivering you liquid nutrients. The taste of sweet ammonia lingers in your mouth.

You do not know how long you have been asleep. You do not recognize this room, but it feels comforting. A womb.

The computer terminal sings to you. "<t>{^$PC_job} {$PC_last}, {$PC_first}. We await you.</t>"
