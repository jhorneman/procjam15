<meta id='womb' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the womb.</leadin>
You're in the womb.

The huge vaulted room stands largely vacant, the endometria covering the inner hull dripping with thick fluid, waiting for the next shipment to arrive.

The other half of the room is filled with misshapen egg pouches and pustules, harnessed together with fascia and knotted strands of hair. A pile of broken egg pouches lie scattered across the soft, giving floor where the fascia failed them.

<meta id='umbilical cord' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the umbilical cord.</leadin>
You're in one of the main umbilical cords.

Membranes drip and shed in layers as you shine your light along the walls. You walk slowly, your feet sticking to the soft skin lining the floor.  Round sphincters punctuate the umbilical lining at regular intervals, but none of them open as you apply pressure. A few cysts and pustules lie on the ground as though abandoned in haste.

One of the sphincters stands partly open, its muscles too weak to keep its contents from spilling out onto the umbilical floor from the dark cavity beyond it.

<meta id='stomach' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the stomach.</leadin>
You're in the stomach.

Small sheets of cartilage,  masses of bone, and chunks of undigested organic material float in a thick acidic slush that reaches to your knees. You wade through it and investigate the great curving room only to find it equally abandoned, and the smell of decay overwhelming.

Alternate sucking and bubbling noises come from the direction of the duodenum as it slowly swallows and filters the stomach fluids.

<leadin>Search within the carapace.</leadin>
You're within a carapace.

A large, thick chitinous shell separates you from the darkness of space beyond it. The light from your flashlight is just enough to make out the basic shapes in the room.

Cold sterile metal sheets lay in patchwork as exoskeletons for the fleshy globules growing like soft arteries along the floors and walls. Boils and carbuncles burst from the seams throughout the room, ignored by the ship's inhabitants.

<leadin>Search the starboard glands</leadin>
You're in one of the starboard glands.

All around you thick pink tissues secrete hormones from their pores in a fine mist. The air around you tastes sweet, inviting.

A large transparent membrane covers one wall, allowing you to glimpse the outer hull of the ship. Giant ribs clutch the metal hull, covered in bone and cartilage growths where the solar arrays used to be.

<leadin>Search the portside canal.</leadin>
You're in the portside canal.

Tufts of fabric and paperwork are scattered everywhere, embedded in the thick waxy gunk lining the canal. You shine your light into the amber mucilage. Dark solid masses seem to float within it.

Desks lay overturned, drawers open and spilling their contents across the floor. Little hairs tickle and investigate your feet as you walk further into the room.

<leadin>Search the ventricle.</leadin>
You in the left ventricle.

The muscular tube contracts and tightens as you walk along its mucous membrane. You touch the wall and it leaves a red glistening residue on your hands.

The ventricle here is wide, but you stoop to prevent your head from grazing the low membrane ceiling. Several panels lie on the floor, revealing tangled knots of colorful capillaries, a clump of neurons sending instructions between the various ship systems.

You are in the gallbladder.

The room is full of calcium rocks, some as big as a human adult, nested in the red, inflamed flesh covering the floor. A layer of bile covers everything and drips in thick yellow clumps from holes in the ceiling. 

Various ducts lines the room. They make a suckling sound as they drink the mysterious fluid soup.

You are inside the liver.

You cough loudly and your eyes tear up with the toxic fumes. You cover your face and enter the giant gland. The taste of ammonia touches your tongue every time you breathe.

The room is filled with knotted proteins suspended above you on sinewy strings. Wide, soft red blood cells float in liquified fats. The organic machinery hums with biochemical synthesis.

<leadin>Search the bronchial airways.</leadin>
You are in the bronchial airways.

You carefully remove the maintenance panel and climb into the lower airways, just large enough for you to crouch within. As you lift your hand over the opening of an alveolar duct, you feel hot, humid air flowing through the ship.

The bronchi shafts criss-cross the entire ship like a respiratory system, feeding the port and starboard lungs fresh oxygen to be filtered throughout the rest of the ship's body. The walls are lined with flexible cartilage barely concealing various valves and nodules.

You are in the somatic nervous system

You ignore the large sign declaring "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY" to enter the nervous system. Schematics pinned to the membranous walls show the skeletal structure of the ship. Small electrical pulses cause the muscles and machines lining the wall to twitch and react, sending nervous signals to the far corners of the ship.

<leadin>Search the thorax.</leadin>
You are in the thorax.

The central cavity is mostly empty, with giant metal-plated ribs lining the inner hull. Thick metal and bone supports jut through the room irregularly, while wire mesh and cartilage hold together various machines and body parts suspended between them.

This area is not meant for human exploration standing as it does between the other rooms and organs of the ship. You are careful as you walk along it's slick curved surface.

<leadin>Search the small intestines.</leadin>
You are at the small intestines.

The coils of intestines, large enough in diameter that a full-bodied adult could stand within them, snake through the former recycling center. The flesh stretches as large, solid matter is pushed through via peristalsis, leeching it of useful nutrients. Fluids squirt out of its pores to help lubricate the process as it strains to move waste through its flexible tissue.

The ships bowels already overflow with trash, the organic solids piling high and poisoning the air with their putrid odors.

<meta id='placental pouch' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the placental pouch.</leadin>
You are in the placental pouch.

It stands inflated but not entirely vacant. Yellow and white embryos covered in a netting of red sinew grow from the inner lining of the room.  They throb as they absorb nutrients from throughout the ship.

One of the embryonic clusters has burst open, revealing an empty cavity within it.

Wire shelves stand empty and boxes overturned, their contents spilled across the floor of the ship. A refrigerator leaks blue coolant onto the white tiles. You step among the sticky sodas, processed meat products, digital magazines, souvenirs and other human artifacts as you peer through the commissary for something to salvage.

You are in the ovaries.

You step carefully over unfertilized eggs scattered across the floor, some leaking a sticky substance.

Small tumors grow haphazardly out of bone and cartilage. Unidentified pustules stand in the corners of the small room, occasionally twitching and squirting a pungent yellow fluid.

You are in the gills.

Beige and brown flecks of scabs, dried and desiccated, sit on the floor. As the shop breathes, cords of flesh light up with white florescent chemicals as the gills attempt to filter out the impurities. A fine sickly sweet mist sprays down upon you from pores in the ceiling.

You are in the endocrine system. 

The room is large but busy with the ship's metabolic processes. Giant tubes of flesh beat in regular rhythm as they pump precious hormones throughout the ship. The endocrine system feeds the massive transformation.

The tubes of flesh are thick and sturdy, resisting any attempt at sabotage. You climb over them and duck beneath them as you explore the room for data to salvage.

You feel the hot sickly sweet air hit you as you enter the room. Scattered equipment and pustules lie littered around row after row of fluid-covered consoles.  Large valves on the wall open and close in regular rhythm as oxygen and nitrogen flow through the system.

Scanners powered by an unknown backup systems still print out readouts from various parts of the body, confirming structural integrity.

You are in the lymphatic system.

You enter one of several rooms lined with a strange fluid, like congealed broth. Web-like lymph nodes in the ceilings continue to secrete a sweet odor. The crew's beds lay unmade, blankets and membranes dispersed across the room. The furniture appears to be made of cartilage.

As the power surges, music suddenly interrupts the slow labored breathing of the ship... only to fade once again with the lights.
