<meta id='womb' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the womb.</leadin>
You're in the womb.

The huge vaulted room stands largely vacant, the endometrius covering the inner hull dripping with thick fluid, waiting for the next shipment to arrive.

The other half of the room is filled with mishapen egg pouches and pustules, harnessed together with fascia and knotted strands of hair. A pile of broken egg pouches lie scattered across the soft, giving floor where the fascia failed them.

<meta id='umbilical cord' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the umbilical cord.</leadin>
You're in one of the main umbilical cords.

Membranes drip and shed in layers as you shine your light along the walls. You walk slowly, your feet sticking to the soft skin lining the floor.  Round sphincters punctuate the umbilical lining at regular intervals, but none of them open as you apply pressure. A few cysts and pustules lie on the ground as though abandoned in haste.

One of the sphincters stands partly open, its muscles too weak to keep its contents from spilling out onto the umbilical floor from the dark cavity beyond it.

<meta id='stomach' tags='mission, flesh_act5, style_mission'/>
<leadin>Search the stomach.</leadin>
You're in the stomach.

Small sheets of cartilage,  masses of bone, and chunks of undigested organic material float in a thick acidic slush that reaches to your knees. You wade through it and investigate the great curving room only to find it equally abandoned, and the smell of decay overwhelming.

Alternate sucking and bubbling noises come from the direction of the duodenum as it slowly swallows and filters the stomach fluids.

<leadin>Search within the carapace.</leadin>
You're within a carapace.

A large, thick chitinous shell separates you from the darkness of space beyond it. The light from your flashlight is just enough to make out the basic shapes in the room.

Cold sterile metal sheets lay in patchwork as exoskeletons for the fleshy globules growing like soft arteries along the floors and walls. Boils and carbuncles burst from the seams throughout the room, ignored by the ship's inhabitants.

<leadin>Search the starboard glands</leadin>
You're in a gland. It is familiar, like the solar arrays xx

You can see them from the window, like giant satellite dishes meant to always point towards the nearest source of solar energy. You can only see them blinking in red emergency lights that fan across the outer hull of the ship. When the lights turn off, all you see is blackness against the stars. 

The solar arrays are inoperational, but there's no sun to feed them anyway. They will not help direct power to the mainframe.

You're in a canal lined with hair and wax, like an administration office. xx

Papers are scattered everywhere between overturned desks, drawers open and spilling their contents across the floor. Charts and calenders outlining deadlines and projected earnings hang limply on the walls.

You in the left ventricle. It is familiar, like the upper maintenance shaft. xx

The shafts here are wide, but you stoop to prevent your head from grazing the low ceiling. Several panels lie on the floor, revealing tangled knots of colorful wires, a clump of neurons sending instructions between the various ship systems.

You are in the gallbladder. It is familiar, like the small laboratory on the starboard side. xx

The room is full of various lab equipment, both familiar and foreign - centrifuges, microscopes, bioscanners. A set of test tubes contain the chemical analysis for biological compounds brought from the hydroponics gardens. Your feet crunch on broken glass leaking mysterious fluids. A single flourescent light swings slowly from the ceiling, animating the shadows.

Rows of consoles, large screens left static or dark, computers useless with so little power, largely controlled by the mainframe itself. Gravity online. How long will that last?

<leadin>Search the bronchial airways.</leadin>
You are in the bronchial airways.

You carefully remove the maintenance panel and climb into the lower airways, just large enough for you to crouch within. As you lift your hand over the opening of an alveolar duct, you feel hot, humid air flowing through the ship.

The bronchi shafts criss-cross the entire ship like a respiratory system, feeding the port and starboard lungs fresh oxygen to be filtered throughout the rest of the ship's body. The walls are lined with flexible cartilage barely concealing various valves and and nobules.

You are in the somatic nervous system

You ignore the large sign declaring "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY" to enter the nervous system. Schematics pinned to the membranous walls show the skeletal structure of the ship. Small electrical pulses cause the muscles and machines lining the wall to twitch and react, sending nervous signals to the far corners of the ship.

Piloting on standby. Coordinates unknown. Scanners offline. The emptiness of space is the only thing that has kept this unmanned ship from breaking into debris. No sign of pilot. Dust has begun to settle on the flightsticks.

You are in the small intestines. It is familiar, like the main recycling hub. xx

A conveyor belt grinds loudly back and forth on broken gears, shortened by the electrical surges. Trash lines the belt and various bins labeled "ORGANIC WASTE" and "MECHANICAL WASTE" and so on. Trash chutes lay open, their trash sitting in unmoving, unfiltered piles of the floor where they overflowed.

You are in the small intestines. It is familiar, like the research and development labs. xx

You've never been allowed in here before. The door sputters on broken hinges, and a voice repeats, "<t>ACCESS RESTRICTED</t>". You walk into it anyway.

The labs are lined with busy rows and shelves of vials and containers with various biological specimens floating in unidentified murky liquid.

You are in the placental pouch. It is familiar, like the commissary. xx

Wire shelves stand empty and boxes overturned, their contents spilled across the floor of the ship. A refrigerator leaks blue coolant onto the white tiles. You step among the sticky sodas, processed meat products, digital magazines, souvenirs and other human artifacts as you peer through the commissary for something to salvage.

The huge structure curves with the hull of the ship. Shuttles stand silent, parked meticulously within their lines. Escape pod doors remain closed, undisturbed, all accounted for. Between the shuttles stand various mechanical equipment for vehicle repairs and servicing.

No one has left the ship, but if they had there is nowhere they could go. Only empty space.

Rows of monitors and tonsils remain offline and unresponsive. The beam from your flashlight glitters on the saliva. You walk along the soft palate. The vocal chords vibrate and sing as humid air blasts through the vents.

You are in the gills.

Beige and brown flecks of scabs, dried and desiccated, sit on the floor. As the shop breathes, cords of flesh light up with white florescent chemicals as the gils attempt to filter out the impurities. A fine sickly sweet mist sprays down upon you from pores in the ceiling.

You are in the endocrine system. 

The room is large but busy with the ship's metabolic processes. Giant tubes of flesh beat in regular rhythm as they pump precious hormones throughout the ship. The endocrine system feeds the massive transformation.

The tubes of flesh are thick and sturdy, resisting any attempt at sabotage. You climb over them and duck beneath them as you explore the room for data to salvage.

You are in the respiratory system.

You feel the hot sickly sweet air hit you as you enter the room. Scattered equipment and pustules lie littered around row after row of fluid-covered consoles.  Large valves on the wall open and close in regular rhythm as oxygen and nitrogen flow through the system.

Scanners powered by an unknown backup systems still print out readouts from various parts of the body, confirming structural integrity.

You are in the lymphatic system.

You enter one of several rooms lined with a strange fluid, like congealed broth. Web-like lymph nodes in the ceilings continue to secrete a sweet odor. The crew's beds lay unmade, blankets and membranes dispered across the room. The furniture appears to be made of cartilage.

As the power surges, music suddenly interrupts the slow labored breathing of the ship... only to fade once again with the lights.

You step carefully over unfertilized eggs scattered across the floor, some leaking a sticky substance.

Small tumors grow haphazardly out of bone and cartilage. Unidentified pustules stand in the corners of the small room, occasionally twitching and squirting a pungent yellow fluid.
