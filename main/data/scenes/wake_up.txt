<leadin>Wake up...</leadin>
(custom)<br />
You wake up with a start. How long have you been asleep? What has happened? <br />
Your training kicks in and you take stock of the situation. You're lying on a cot. You're on the ship.<br />
Everything seems fine. No blinking lights. No sirens. <br />
A message awaits you. <br />
"Private {$PC_last}, {$PC_first}. Please report to the computer room." <br />

The computer room? Better go see what that is about.<br />
