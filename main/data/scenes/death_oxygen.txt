You're not familiar with these controls, but this button should change the... the room door clangs shut. It looks like you're sealed in.

You put the controls back the way they were. You hear a beep, a fizzing sound, then the words "RAPID OXYGEN DUMP INITIATED" appear on the control panel and a counter starts counting down from 100%.

A loud hissing sound comes from the ceiling.

<leadin>Press the abort switch.</leadin>
The counter is at 50%. Your ears pop due to the low pressure. You press the abort switch, but the only consequence is a low oxygen warning signal.

The warning signal becomes quieter and quieter as there is no more air to carry sound. Panicked and weak, you try slamming the emergency button, but it has no effect. Hyperventilating, you collapse in front of the control panel.
