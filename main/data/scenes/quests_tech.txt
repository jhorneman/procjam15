You're on the engineering deck.

Scattered equipment and personal effects of the engineering crew lie littered around row after row of consoles. Scanners powered by an unknown backup generator still print out readouts from various parts of the ship, confirming structural integrity.

Another door leads to the maintenance bay. A plasma torch left deep scars in the metal where it was sealed shut manually from inside.

You're in the hangar bay.

The huge structure curves with the hull of the ship. Shuttles stand silent, parked meticulously within their lines. Escape pod doors remain closed, undisturbed, all accounted for. Between the shuttles stand various mechanical equipment for vehicle repairs and servicing.

No one has left the ship, but if they had there is nowhere they could go. Only empty space.

You're in the lower medbay.

Rows of hospital beds stand undisturbed among a collection of machinery. Centrifuges and blood analysis and urine analysis. UV lines hooked up to monitoring stations and robotic diagnostic stations but no one else nearby. xx

<leadin>Search the hydroponic gardens.</leadin>
You're in the hydroponic gardens.

Gray and brown plants like dried and desiccated in tubs that had once been full of nutrient-rich water. As the uneven power surges through the room and into the machinery, tubes light up with blue florescent chemicals and spray a fine mist from ceiling showerheads. 

Any food left behind in the unattended gardens is inedible, now contaminated with the thick musk of mildew.

<leadin>Search the crew deck.</leadin>
You're on the crew deck.

A huge  common living area with long tables, benches, couches, plastic plants, games, dartboards. Large screens normally show sport recordings from back home but are now all dead. Many of the tables are overturned or covered with half-eaten food. You fiddle with the multimedia controls but only hear static.

<leadin>Search the life support control room.</leadin>
You briefly hesitate before entering the life support control coom. You must be careful looking for data here, or risk upsetting the systems that keep you alive.

It seems this is the only place where power does not fluctuate, except for the lights. Life support runs on an emergency generator, but scavenging or rerouting it for the mainframe means the ship becomes uninhabitable.

Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen are pumped through thrumming high pressure pipes to and from storage tanks and recycling plants. The systems seem to be working, working hard even. Thermal overview maps show abnormally warm levels in various hotspots around the ship.

You're in the main laboratory.

Multiple test chambers allow the scientists on board to perform experiments with zero gravity, high gravity, high pressure... whatever man can do to organic tissue, it can be done here. Machines stand ready to take what is left and to analyze it slice by slice, blood cell by blood cell, molecule by molecule. The main source of test subjects were the mice, but they are all dead.

You're in the maintenance bay.

Huge machines can repair or fabricate anything the ship needs to keep running, from metamaterials to gears and pipes. Normally there is always something being built or repaired here, but without their operators, the machines are nothing but giant, dead blocks of metal.

A few personal effects stop the comparatively large room from appearing completely sterile.

The drawers and cabinet are opened and emptied. Someone else has already searched this place. Did they find what they were looking for?

Rows of consoles, large screens left static or dark, computers useless with so little power, largely controlled by the mainframe itself. Gravity online. How long will that last? xx

You are outside the reactor core.

The large door allows manual access, but has warnings posted over it. Hazard. Radiation warnings. No human access beyond this point. You can see through the layers of pipes and wire meshes steam coming off of a main metal cylinder. The reactor core has not overheated with the lack of power. The monitor shows it is nearing the danger zone. The ship will not survive much longer without a reboot to its systems. The access room/monitoring station has machinery to monitor its status. xx

Piloting on standby. Coordinates unknown. Scanners offline. The emptiness of space is the only thing that has kept this unmanned ship from breaking into debris. No sign of pilot. Dust has begun to settle on the flightsticks. xx

You are at the solar arrays.

You can see them from the window, like giant satellite dishes meant to always point towards the nearest source of solar energy. You can only see them blinking in red emergency lights that fan across the outer hull of the ship. When the lights turn off, all you see is blackness against the stars. xx

The solar arrays are inoperational, but there's no sun to feed them anyway. They will not help direct power to the mainframe.

You've never been allowed in here before. The door sputters on broken hinges, and a voice repeats, "<t>ACCESS RESTRICTED</t>". You walk into it anyway.

The labs are lined with busy rows and shelves of vials and containers with various biological specimens floating in unidentified murky liquid.

A conveyor belt grinds loudly back and forth on broken gears, shortened by the electrical surges. Trash lines the belt and various bins labeled "ORGANIC WASTE" and "MECHANICAL WASTE" and so on. Trash chutes lay open, their trash sitting in unmoving, unfiltered piles of the floor where they overflowed.xx
