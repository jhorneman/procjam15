You're on the engineering deck.

Scattered equipment and personal effects of the engineering crew lie littered around row after row of consoles. Scanners powered by an unknown backup generator still print out readouts from various parts of the ship, confirming structural integrity.

Another door leads to the maintenance bay. A plasma torch left deep scars in the metal where it was sealed shut manually from inside.

You're in the hangar bay.

The huge structure curves with the hull of the ship. Shuttles stand silent, parked meticulously within their lines. Escape pod doors remain closed, undisturbed, all accounted for. Between the shuttles stand various mechanical equipment for vehicle repairs and servicing.

No one has left the ship, but if they had there is nowhere they could go. Only empty space.

You're in the lower medbay.

Rows of hospital beds stand undisturbed among a collection of machinery. Various medical equipment line countertops - centrifuges and urine analysis and various scanners and diagnostic devices. 

IV lines stand hooked up to a monitoring station, but the patient is absent.

<leadin>Search the hydroponic gardens.</leadin>
You're in the hydroponic gardens.

Gray and brown plants like dried and desiccated in tubs that had once been full of nutrient-rich water. As the uneven power surges through the room and into the machinery, tubes light up with blue florescent chemicals and spray a fine mist from ceiling showerheads. 

Any food left behind in the unattended gardens is inedible, now contaminated with the thick musk of mildew.

You're on the crew deck.

A huge  common living area with long tables, benches, couches, plastic plants, games, dartboards. Large screens normally show sport recordings from back home but are now all dead. Many of the tables are overturned or covered with half-eaten food. You fiddle with the multimedia controls but only hear static.

<leadin>Search the life support control room.</leadin>
You briefly hesitate before entering the life support control room. You must be careful looking for data here, or risk upsetting the systems that keep you alive.

It seems this is the only place where power does not fluctuate, except for the lights. Life support runs on an emergency generator, but scavenging or rerouting it for the mainframe means the ship becomes uninhabitable.

Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen are pumped through thrumming high pressure pipes to and from storage tanks and recycling plants. The systems seem to be working, working hard even. Thermal overview maps show abnormally warm levels in various hotspots around the ship.

You're in the main laboratory.

Multiple test chambers allow the scientists on board to perform experiments with zero gravity, high gravity, high pressure... whatever man can do to organic tissue, it can be done here. Machines stand ready to take what is left and to analyze it slice by slice, blood cell by blood cell, molecule by molecule. The main source of test subjects were the mice, but they are all dead.

You're in the maintenance bay.

Huge machines can repair or fabricate anything the ship needs to keep running, from meta-materials to gears and pipes. Normally there is always something being built or repaired here, but without their operators, the machines are nothing but giant, dead blocks of metal.

You're in the command center.

Rows of consoles fill the room, their large screen left static or dark. They all face a blank screen as large as an entire wall that stands as the focal point of the command deck. The computers, which once interfaced with the mainframe and controlled every part of the ship, stand completely useless to you.

<leadin>Search the reactor core.</leadin>
You are outside the reactor core.

You can see through the layers of pipes and wire meshes steam coming off of a main metal cylinder. This is the only place on the ship with full power, the lights casting brightly upon all the instruments. The humming and machinery is deafening as they attempt to keep the core cooled.  

A thermal scanner shows the temperature nearing the danger zone. The ship itself will not survive much longer unless you can reboot the mainframe and gain control over its systems again.

You are at the propulsion systems control in navigation.

The ship pilots itself on standby, keeping it safe and away from dangerous collisions with minimal calculations. You read the coordinates on one of the terminals but cannot understand them.

There is no sign of the pilots, but their belongings remain scattered around the computer consoles.

You are at the solar arrays.

You can see the arrays from the narrow window - giant dishes meant to always point towards the nearest source of solar energy. So far from any suns, you can only see them in the faint light of the red emergency alarms fanning out across the outer hull of the ship.

Without a sun, the solar arrays lie dormant. You will not be able to reroute any to the mainframe from here.

You are in the morgue.

It is normally chilled, but the seals into the room have been ruptured and hot, sticky air pumps in from vents in the ceiling. You can smell the morgue before you even step foot in it.

It is filled with empty hospital beds, cold and clinical to serve the dead rather than the living. Metal drawers with thick, heavy handles sit embedded in the wall, though a few stand ajar. You hesitate to peer inside them.

You are in the radiation shielding control room.

The scanners and readings all appear to be offline, but the backup lights and radiation shields buzz with auxilary power. The wall is unusually warm to the touch and your skin prickles. There is no chance of rerouting this power to the mainframe without risking lethal doses of radiation exposure.

You are at the hydrogen collectors.

A dozen large metal cylinders stand floor to ceiling in a small room adjacent to maintenance. The machinery used to separate hydrogen and oxygen is silent. The consoles appear to be offline and mechanical readings are nonresponsive.

Various valves and small robotic equipment fill the room between the hydrogen collectors.

You are outside the central security office.

You use all of your weight to push open the door before it finally gives. You climb over the furniture used as a makeshift barricade. A second door on the opposite side of the office stands open, the halls beyond it receding into darkness. 

Rows of monitors remain offline and unresponsive. Chairs lay overturned and papers toss across the room. A single red emergency light blinks.

You've never been allowed in here before. The door sputters on broken hinges, and a voice repeats, "<t>ACCESS RESTRICTED</t>". You walk into it anyway.

The labs are lined with busy rows and shelves of vials and containers with various biological specimens floating in unidentified murky liquid.

You are in the armory.

The door stands open, the red emergency lights silent as the power surges have not reached the area. You shine your light into the highly secured room.

Weapons appear to have all been looted hastily, the gate dividing them from the requisitions desk left open and abandoned. There are various boxes and containers still on the shelves, but others have already sifted through most of them.

A conveyor belt carrying trash grinds loudly back and forth on broken gears, shortened by the electrical surges coursing irregularly through the ship.  Various bins labeled "ORGANIC WASTE" and "MECHANICAL WASTE" line the belt but there is no one around to sort them.

The trash chutes lay closed, their contents sitting in unfiltered overflow piles on the floor.

Sterile white suits stand in a crumbled pile, mottled with brown spores and dried blood. The medical equipment is similar to the main medbay, but more vials and tubes remain sealed behind thick barriers labeled "HAZARDOUS".

You walk along the access hall and peer into a series of patient rooms through large glass observation walls. They are empty except for beds and a few personal belongings.

The security office is already open, but the consoles fail to respond to your input. The secure hallway leads you past a row of cells, each separated from you with a thin but extremely strong metal mesh. They appear to be empty.

The last gaol cell stands open, the metal netting twisted and shredded. Tufts of hair and bloodied flesh stick out from the sharp wiring.
