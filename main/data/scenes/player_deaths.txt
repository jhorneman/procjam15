<meta id='death airlock' tags='death_airlock, style_death'/>
<leadin>Use the airlock controls.</leadin>
Servo motors whine and gears grind as you manipulate the airlock controls. The mechanism seems stuck. You jiggle the levers and smash the button until finally something gives.

Panic hits you as you feel the air being sucked away. The airlock is open on both sides! That is supposed to be impossible. You try to grab onto something, but it is too late. The ship expels you into space.
<option action="respawn">You die, alone, in space.</option>

<meta id='upper vents' tags='death_claustrophobia, style_death'/>
<leadin>Climb into the upper ventilation system.</leadin>
You pull yourself up into the shafts of the upper ventilation system. At first you can squeeze through. Then you have to wiggle to fit.

Then you discover you can go neither forward nor backwards. No amount of compressing your body helps. Your hand and feet can't get enough grip on the edges of the ventilation canal to move. Your sweat doesn't help. You call, but there is no response. Your attempts to dislocate something fail. Your blood doesn't help.

<meta id='elevator shaft' tags='death_elevator, style_death'/>
<leadin>Descend elevator shaft.</leadin>
You slide into the gap under the cabin, lower your legs into the elevator shaft, and feel around with your feet. You can't find any kind of steps or service ladder. You slide down further, reaching down as far as you can. Your feel an opening with your toes, and you try to place your foot inside to see if it is big enough. 

The power surges back on with a loud snap. The elevator cabin drops, severing your arms. Helplessly, you fall to the bottom of the shaft.

<meta id='radiation shield gen' tags='death_radiation, style_death'/>
<leadin>Lower radiation shielding.</leadin>
You go over your training. Gamma radiation can be harmful, but only in strong doses.

You activate several override mechanisms to lower the radiation shielding separating you from the radiation of space. As the shield lowers, you are briefly reminded of a trip to the beach you took as a child. The shield slowly descends further. How your mother yelled at you to put on your sunblock.

It occurs to you that you do not know where in space the ship is. Fear hits you in the pit of your stomach. Then you feel sick all over. Your skin begins to hurt. You try to close the shielding again, but it has to open all the way before it can be closed again. Your fumbling movements leave blood and skin on the controls. Your vision is going blurry. Your eyes feel... soft. You turn around, fall on your knees, cry out in pain. Your voice is hoarse, barely a whisper.

<option action="respawn">Your organs dissolve as you try to crawl away.</option>

<scene>
<meta id='inspect fungus' tags='option, biological, medical, style_death'/>
<leadin>Investigate mysterious fungal mass.</leadin>
The body of the fungal mass looks soft and powdery, with little hairs. You're not an expert but it seems a strange thing to find in a place like this.

Here and there, bulbous growths have erupted from the mass, eagerly stretching upwards on thin stalks. The bulbs have the strangest patterns you have ever seen in nature. Fractal mazes, alternating between the artificial and the natural.

As you move in close to observe one of the growths, it vibrates, then suddenly disappears in a puff of dark grey spores. You jerk away but you cannot avoid inhaling some of the spores. You immediately feel an extreme allergic reaction setting in and fall back on the floor. Your upper airways close, asthma makes breathing harder and harder. You cough, ejecting pus, but your air intake dwindles inexorably until you can no longer breathe in or out.

<meta id='tear wires' tags='option, electrical, style_death'/>

You pry off the covering and yank out the heavy electrical cables. You laboriously cut through the thick protective shielding. Finally, you reach the live core. Sparks fly, and the last thing you sense is the smell of burning flesh.
