<meta id='death airlock' tags='death_airlock' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Use the airlock controls.</leadin>
Servo motors whine and gears grind as you manipulate the airlock controls. The mechanism seems stuck. You jiggle the levers and smash the button until finally something gives.

Panic hits you as you feel the air being sucked away. The airlock is open on both sides! That is supposed to be impossible. You try to grab onto something, but it is too late. The ship expels you into space.
<option action="respawn">You die, alone, in space.</option>

<meta id='upper vents' tags='death_claustrophobia' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Climb into the upper ventilation system.</leadin>
You pull yourself up into the shafts of the upper ventilation system. At first you can squeeze through. Then you have to wiggle to fit.

Then you discover you can go neither forward nor backwards. No amount of compressing your body helps. Your hand and feet can't get enough grip on the edges of the ventilation canal to move. Your sweat doesn't help. You call, but there is no response. Your attempts to dislocate something fail. Your blood doesn't help.

<meta id='elevator shaft' tags='death_elevator' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Descend elevator shaft.</leadin>
You slide into the gap under the cabin, lower your legs into the elevator shaft, and feel around with your feet. You can't find any kind of steps or service ladder. You slide down further, reaching down as far as you can. Your feel an opening with your toes, and you try to place your foot inside to see if it is big enough. 

The power surges back on with a loud snap. The elevator cabin drops, severing your arms. Helplessly, you fall to the bottom of the shaft.

<option action="respawn">You bleed out and die.</option>

<meta id='radiation shield gen' tags='death_radiation' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Lower radiation shielding.</leadin>
You go over your training. Gamma radiation can be harmful, but only in strong doses.

You activate several override mechanisms to lower the radiation shielding separating you from the radiation of space. As the shield lowers, you are briefly reminded of a trip to the beach you took as a child. The shield slowly descends further. How your mother yelled at you to put on your sunblock.

It occurs to you that you do not know where in space the ship is. Fear hits you in the pit of your stomach. Then you feel sick all over. Your skin begins to hurt. You try to close the shielding again, but it has to open all the way before it can be closed again. Your fumbling movements leave blood and skin on the controls. Your vision is going blurry. Your eyes feel... soft. You turn around, fall on your knees, cry out in pain. Your voice is hoarse, barely a whisper.

<scene>
<meta id='inspect fungus' tags='option, biological, medical' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Investigate mysterious fungal mass.</leadin>
The body of the fungal mass looks soft and powdery, with little hairs. You're not an expert but it seems a strange thing to find in a place like this.

Here and there, bulbous growths have erupted from the mass, eagerly stretching upwards on thin stalks. The bulbs have the strangest patterns you have ever seen in nature. Fractal mazes, alternating between the artificial and the natural.

As you move in close to observe one of the growths, it vibrates, then suddenly disappears in a puff of dark grey spores. You jerk away but you cannot avoid inhaling some of the spores. You immediately feel an extreme allergic reaction setting in and fall back on the floor. Your upper airways close, asthma makes breathing harder and harder. You cough, ejecting pus, but your air intake dwindles inexorably until you can no longer breathe in or out.

<!-- ELECTRICAL -->

<scene>
<meta id='tear wires' tags='option, electrical' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Cut electrical wiring.</leadin>
You pry off the covering and yank out the heavy electrical cables. The power in the ship surges slightly, showering you with sparks. You wait for it to recede and the room to go dark before continuing.

You laboriously cut through the thick protective shielding, tossing it to reveal the live core. You reach for it as the power suddenly swells. Sparks fly, and the last thing you sense is the smell of burning flesh.

<meta id='unidentified substance' tags='option, flesh' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Touch unidentified substance.</leadin>
You touch the unindentified substance. It's slick.... warm. Pleasant, almost.

The viscosity seems to change the more you touch it. It goes from slick to oozing to sticky. You pull your hand away and long filaments drip off your fingers. A gentle tingling turns into a slight burning situation.

You try to get the substance off your hand but only succeed in getting it on your other hand. The burning feeling intensifies. You become flushed, and woozy. Your increasingly frantic movements get more and more of the toxic substance over you. Clumsily, you slip, and fall face-forward into the noxious stuff. You turn and struggle, weaker and weaker, as the substance creeps over you, invading you through every orifice, burning.

<scene>
<meta id='undulating sphincter' tags='option, flesh' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Reach inside an undulating sphincter.</leadin>
You reach your hand past the sphincter, into the narrow canal behind it. You feel an object, but the increasingly rapid undulations move it out of reach. The movements speed up as you reach in deeper, panting, until you are in up to your shoulder. Then the flesh spasms, tightening around your arm, then slowly crushing it. You feel pain, hear bones snap. Your blood drips out of the orifice. The pressure keeps increasing.
<option action="respawn">You scream and scream before you die of shock.</option>
</scene>

<scene>
<meta id='taste liquid' tags='option, flesh' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Taste liquid excretions.</leadin>
You run your fingers along a bulbous tumor, dragging it through the viscous excretion.

You can't seem to help yourself. It smells so sweet, so alluring. You taste it.

At first it's like the sweetest nectar you've ever tasted. But as you lick your lips you find your tongue has sealed itself to the roof of your mouth. Your lips refuse to separate.

Your throat, coated in the cloying glue, closes. You try to scream but no sound escapes.

<option action="respawn">You suffocate, sweetly.</option>

<scene>
<meta id='gastric acid' tags='option, flesh' styles='style_death'/>
<leadin>Wade into gastric acid.</leadin>
You wade into a pool of gastic acid, hoping to salvage something of use beneath its surface.

As you descend, the acid sizzles around your clothes and then your skin as it attempts to digest you. You feel your skin sting as it peels. You struggle as the pain becomes unbearable.

You throw your weight onto your foot to spring yourself over the side of the pool, but the tendons dissolves. You hang on limply as each layer of your body digests. Your skin. Your tendons. Your organs. Your cartilage. Eventually, you lose your grip and fall beneath the surface of the acid.

<option action="respawn">You die, your body digested and recycled as nutrient slush.</option>
